# AI Agents Overview

AI Agents are autonomous systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They represent a key step toward more intelligent and adaptable AI systems.

## What are AI Agents?

An AI agent is a system that:
- **Perceives** its environment through sensors
- **Reasons** about the current situation
- **Makes decisions** based on goals and knowledge
- **Acts** in the environment through actuators
- **Learns** from experience to improve performance

## Types of AI Agents

### 1. Simple Reflex Agents
- React directly to current percepts
- Use condition-action rules
- No memory of past states
- **Example**: Thermostat, basic chatbots

### 2. Model-Based Reflex Agents
- Maintain internal state/model of world
- Handle partially observable environments
- Track changes over time
- **Example**: Navigation systems

### 3. Goal-Based Agents
- Have explicit goals to achieve
- Plan sequences of actions
- Consider future consequences
- **Example**: Trip planning agents

### 4. Utility-Based Agents
- Have utility function to measure "happiness"
- Optimize for maximum expected utility
- Handle conflicting goals
- **Example**: Investment advisors

### 5. Learning Agents
- Improve performance through experience
- Adapt to new situations
- Update knowledge and strategies
- **Example**: Recommendation systems

## Agent Architectures

### Reactive Architecture
- Direct mapping from sensors to actuators
- Fast response time
- Limited reasoning capability
- Good for real-time systems

### Deliberative Architecture
- Explicit reasoning and planning
- Maintains world model
- Slower but more flexible
- Good for complex problems

### Hybrid Architecture
- Combines reactive and deliberative layers
- Fast reflexes + deliberate planning
- Most practical for real-world applications
- **Example**: Autonomous vehicles

## Key Components

### Perception System
- **Sensors**: Cameras, microphones, keyboards
- **Preprocessing**: Filtering, normalization
- **Feature Extraction**: Relevant information identification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding sensor data

### Knowledge Representation
- **Facts**: What the agent knows about the world
- **Rules**: How things work and relate
- **Goals**: What the agent wants to achieve
- **Beliefs**: Uncertain knowledge about the world

### Reasoning Engine
- **Planning**: Sequence of actions to achieve goals
- **Decision Making**: Choosing between alternatives
- **Problem Solving**: Finding solutions to obstacles
- **Learning**: Updating knowledge from experience

### Action Selection
- **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions
- **Execution**: Carrying out selected actions
- **Monitoring**: Checking action outcomes
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting based on results

## Modern AI Agent Frameworks

### LangChain
- Framework for building LLM-powered applications
- Chains of reasoning and action
- Memory and tool integration
- **Use Cases**: Chatbots, document analysis, code generation

### LangGraph
- Graph-based agent framework

- Iterative improvement
- **Use Cases**: Software development, content creation

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Interleaves reasoning and acting
- Uses language models for both
- Improved performance on complex tasks
- **Use Cases**: Question answering, fact checking

## Agent Communication

### Multi-Agent Systems
- Multiple agents working together
- Coordination and cooperation
- Negotiation and competition
- **Examples**: Distributed problem solving, markets
