# Reinforcement Learning Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

RL is inspired by behavioral psychology and focuses on how software agents should take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL learns from interaction rather than labeled data.

## Key Components

### Agent
The learner or decision maker that takes actions in the environment.

### Environment
The external system that the agent interacts with and receives feedback from.

### State (S)
The current situation or configuration of the environment that the agent observes.

### Action (A)
The set of all possible moves the agent can make in a given state.

### Reward (R)
The feedback signal from the environment that evaluates the quality of an action.

### Policy (π)
The strategy or mapping from states to actions that the agent follows.

## The RL Process

1. **Observe** current state
2. **Select** action based on policy
3. **Execute** action in environment
4. **Receive** reward and new state
5. **Update** policy based on experience
6. **Repeat** until goal achieved

## Types of RL

### Model-Free RL
Agent learns directly from experience without building a model of the environment.

**Examples**: Q-Learning, SARSA, Policy Gradients

### Model-Based RL
Agent first learns a model of the environment, then uses it for planning.

**Examples**: Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo Tree Search

### On-Policy vs Off-Policy

**On-Policy**: Learns about the policy being followed
- Example: SARSA

**Off-Policy**: Learns about optimal policy while following another policy
- Example: Q-Learning

## Core Algorithms

### Value-Based Methods

**Q-Learning**:
- Learns action-value function Q(s,a)
- Off-policy temporal difference learning
- Converges to optimal policy

**SARSA**:
- State-Action-Reward-State-Action
- On-policy temporal difference learning
- More conservative than Q-Learning

### Policy-Based Methods

**REINFORCE**:
- Direct policy optimization
- Uses policy gradient
- Good for continuous action spaces

**Actor-Critic**:
- Combines value and policy methods
- Actor: policy function
- Critic: value function

### Deep RL

**Deep Q-Network (DQN)**:
- Uses neural networks for Q-function
- Experience replay
- Target networks

**Policy Gradient Methods**:
- TRPO, PPO, A3C
- Direct policy optimization with neural networks

## Key Concepts

### Exploration vs Exploitation
- **Exploitation**: Choose actions known to yield high rewards
- **Exploration**: Try new actions to discover better strategies
- **ε-greedy**: Balance with probability ε for exploration

### Temporal Difference Learning
Updates value estimates based on other estimates:
```
V(s) ← V(s) + α[R + γV(s') - V(s)]
```

### Bellman Equation
Fundamental recursive relationship for optimal value functions:
```
V*(s) = max_a Σ P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV*(s')]
```

## Advantages

✅ **No Labeled Data**: Learns from trial and error  
✅ **Adaptive**: Handles dynamic environments  
✅ **Optimal Solutions**: Can find globally optimal policies  
✅ **General Purpose**: Applicable to many domains
