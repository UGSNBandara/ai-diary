# Supervised Learning Overview

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Definition

In supervised learning, we have:
- **Input features (X)**: The independent variables
- **Target labels (y)**: The dependent variable we want to predict
- **Training data**: Pairs of (X, y) used to train the model

## Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. Classification
Predicting discrete categories or classes.

**Examples:**
- Email spam detection (spam/not spam)
- Image classification (cat/dog/bird)
- Medical diagnosis (disease/no disease)

**Common Algorithms:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

### 2. Regression
Predicting continuous numerical values.

**Examples:**
- House price prediction
- Stock market forecasting
- Temperature prediction

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge/Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Supervised Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather labeled training data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data
3. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant input features
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm
5. **Training**: Fit the model to training data
6. **Evaluation**: Test model performance on unseen data
7. **Deployment**: Use model for predictions

## Key Considerations

- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data but fails on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture patterns
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balance between model complexity and generalization
- **Cross-validation**: Technique to assess model performance
