# Deep Learning Basics

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning mimics the way human brains process information through networks of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. The "deep" refers to the multiple hidden layers between input and output.

## Neural Network Architecture

### Basic Components

**Neuron (Node)**:
- Receives inputs
- Applies weights and bias
- Uses activation function
- Produces output

**Layers**:
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform data
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions

### Mathematical Foundation

**Linear Transformation**:
```
z = W·x + b
```

**Activation Function**:
```
a = f(z)
```

**Common Activation Functions**:
- **ReLU**: `f(x) = max(0, x)`
- **Sigmoid**: `f(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x))`
- **Tanh**: `f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/(e^x + e^(-x))`
- **Softmax**: `f(xi) = e^xi / Σe^xj`

## Types of Neural Networks

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks
- Information flows in one direction
- Fully connected layers
- Good for: tabular data, simple classification

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Uses convolution operations
- Spatial hierarchies in data
- Good for: images, spatial data

### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Has memory/feedback loops
- Processes sequential data
- Good for: text, time series, speech

### 4. Transformer Networks
- Attention-based architecture
- Parallel processing
- Good for: NLP, machine translation

## Training Process

### Forward Propagation
1. Input data flows through network
2. Each layer transforms the data
3. Final layer produces prediction
4. Calculate loss/error

### Backpropagation
1. Calculate gradient of loss
2. Propagate gradients backward
3. Update weights using gradients
4. Repeat for next batch

### Loss Functions

**Classification**:
- **Binary Cross-Entropy**: For binary classification
- **Categorical Cross-Entropy**: For multi-class classification

**Regression**:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

## Optimization Algorithms

### Gradient Descent Variants
- **SGD**: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Adam**: Adaptive Moment Estimation
- **RMSprop**: Root Mean Square Propagation
- **AdaGrad**: Adaptive Gradient Algorithm

### Learning Rate
- Controls step size in optimization
- **Too high**: May overshoot optimal solution
- **Too low**: Slow convergence
- **Adaptive**: Changes during training

## Deep Learning Advantages

✅ **Automatic Feature Learning**: No manual feature engineering  
✅ **Complex Patterns**: Captures non-linear relationships  
✅ **Scalability**: Performance improves with more data  
✅ **Versatility**: Works across domains (vision, NLP, speech)  
✅ **End-to-end Learning**: Raw input to final output  

## Deep Learning Challenges

❌ **Data Hungry**: Requires large datasets  
❌ **Computational Cost**: Needs powerful hardware (GPUs)  
❌ **Black Box**: Difficult to interpret decisions  
❌ **Overfitting**: Can memorize training data  
❌ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Many parameters to optimize  

## Regularization Techniques

### Dropout
Randomly sets some neurons to zero during training to prevent overfitting.

### Batch Normalization
Normalizes inputs to each layer to accelerate training.

### Early Stopping
Stops training when validation performance stops improving.

### L1/L2 Regularization
Adds penalty term to loss function to prevent large weights.
